								<h3 id="question">Why is Javacript so powerful and how does it differ to coffee script</h3>
								<p>
										ECMAScript is the name of the official specification, created and maintained by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) international, hence the name.

										JavaScript is the most popular implementation of ECMAScript in use today, but it is not the only one; JScript is Microsoft’s implementation of ECMAScript in IE browsers, and ActionScript was Macromedia/Adobe’s version. Usually when people talk about JavaScript, they actually mean ECMAScript, but it's fine because everyone knows what they mean.
										
										Both JavaScript and JScript were created before ECMAScript existed - the reason ECMAScript was created was to standardize the various implementations between competing browsers (around the time of the first browser wars).
